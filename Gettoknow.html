        <h3>introduction</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Arnica Safari. I'm 21 years old. I was borned in Zahedan in 2005, in south-east of Iran.
            I've lived in Tehran for 12 years. During highshool, Chemistry and Biology appeared to me, thus i applied
            for pharamy English course in 2025 after Podfak course to get russian's blue diploma.
            I found camputer science an essential field to learn, the job opportunities are highly demanded.
            I decided to learn a bit more on that. Back-ends such as C++ was tough to deal with for longer time, 
            Now i am trying web design which i like more.
